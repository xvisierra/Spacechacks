## 💡 Inspiration ![h4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74637789/132989784-04d2e815-1552-4642-95c1-c03be72de800.jpg)
🦕
Schools always taught us history in a boring way which made everyone sleepy, right? Well we are here to change that with **No Internet**. We thought of teaching history in a fun, new way where you will know every thing from the start of life to now. You might have guessed from the name itself what inspired us the most is the dino when your internet dies. Let your internet switch off and time machine turn on!

## ⚙ What it does 🦕
This game is inspired by chrome dino but its more fun and filled with knowledge. Ask how? No Internet helps you learn facts of pre historic life till now. The evolution of life can be seen as you start winning more levels. The more levels you win, the more knowledge you gain and you'll see how much your character has evolved.

## 🔧 How we built it 🦕
We built it by HTML, CSS and javascript. We made a basic game first and built on it to add more levels and to show the evolution. Then we displayed facts related to each era as our character evolves.

## 💪 Challenges we ran into 🦕
We were not able to sync the character and facts to show along as they evolved at first. We faced few difficulties in making the levels of game showing all the character development till human which is last level.

## 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of 🦕
Finally we made something which is fun to use as a break from studies and it still provides you with knowledge.

## 📚 What we learned 🦕
We learned how to make games with levels, we learned to use cockroach db although we could not use it in the end.

## ⏭  What's next for No Internet 🦕
Plan to store all the scores of users, show who is the highest scorer and adding more facts and charecters.
